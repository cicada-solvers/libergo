# LiberGo

## Description
There were some desires for people to be able to use some of the utilities in the LPAT (Liber Primus Analysis Tool)
that I had been working on.  This is simpler tool written in Go for performance reasons.

## Tools
genseq - This is used for generating a series of numeric sequences.
isprime - This is used for checking if a number is prime.
rencode - This is used for encoding and decoding runes to latin characters.
